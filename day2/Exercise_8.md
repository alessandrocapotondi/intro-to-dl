# Exercise 8

In this exercise, we try using multiple GPUs.

## Task 1

Convert a script or scripts from one of the earlier exercises to use
multiple GPUs. 

The easiest option is to work with the script
[pytorch_dvc_cnn_simple.py](pytorch_dvc_cnn_simple.py), but more
complex models may benefit more from scaling up to multiple GPUs.

- Do you get improvements in speed?
- Do you get the same accuracy as with a single GPU?
