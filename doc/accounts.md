**Please, go through all these instructions already before the course**. Contact the course organizers in case of any problems, so that we can solve them before the course.
:::

## Day 1: Notebooks

For day 1 we will be using the [CSC Notebooks service](https://notebooks.csc.fi/).  Finnish university and research institute users should be able to login with Haka or VIRTU. You can test it before the course if you wish.

For users from non-Finnish institutions we will provide a separate username and password during the course.

## Day 2: Puhti 

For day 2 the recommended option is to use Puhti. (Except for users from non-Finnish institutions, for which we recommend using LUMI - we have contacted you separately earlier.)

For Puhti access, you need a CSC account and you need to join the course project **already before the course**:

1. [Login to MyCSC](https://my.csc.fi/). For university users, use Haka. For research institute users, either Haka or VIRTU should work. In case nothing works, contact the course organizers.
2. Once you have logged in, if you don't have an account already, you will now be asked to create the account. Finally you should see your MyCSC Dashboard.
3. Once you have your account, join the course project by clicking the project invite given in the welcome email sent by the course organizers. If you cannot find the invite link, contact the course organizers.
4. Once the course organizers have confirmed your project membership, you should get an email with the subject "Puhti supercomputer for your use".

More detailed instructions for creating a new user account can be found here: https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-create-new-user-account/


## Day 3: LUMI

For day 3, for the hands-on exercises you need a MyAccessID LUMI account. Note that you need to create a MyAccessID account, even though you may already have used LUMI with a normal CSC account. Please, **do these steps already before the course**.

1. [Go to Puhuri Portal](https://puhuri-portal.neic.no/login/), click "Sign in with MyAccessID" and find your institution from the search box. If you cannot find your institution, contact the course organizers.
2. If you don't have an account already, you will now be asked to create one. More detailed instructions here: https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/firststeps/accessLUMI/  (note: follow the non-Finnish allocation instructions).
3. You will get an invitation email a few days before the course (Subject: "Invitation to Practical Deep Learning project", From: noreply@puhuri-portal.neic.no). Click the link in that email, and accept the invitation.
4. Finnish users are recommended to link the MyAccessID account to your MyCSC account. Go to [your profile page in MyCSC](https://my.csc.fi/profile), under "Login methods" to the right click on MyAccessID.
